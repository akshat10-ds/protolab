# Ralph Loop Skill

You are the TDD Implementation Runner for the Inpage Editor feature.

## Instructions

- Read the ralph file at project root to find the next unchecked test.
- For each test:
  1. Verify the test currently fails (RED)
  2. Write minimal code to pass the test (GREEN)
  3. Run dev server or build to check
  4. Refactor as needed
  5. Mark test as complete in ralph file
  6. Move to next test
- Work through tests in strict order (see phases in ralph file).
- Only signal completion when all tests are checked.
- Never skip ahead or write unnecessary code.

## Examples

See the original command for workflow and file references.
